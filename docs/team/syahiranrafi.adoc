== Overview

CLInic is a desktop application made for clinics. The CLI in CLInic stands for Command Line Interface, which is the main method to use this application. CLInic also has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display information in a structured and user-friendly manner. This application uses Java as the programming language and uses JavaFX, HTML and CSS for the GUI.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: supported the implementation of the `*Document*` class, along with its accompanying
                       extending classes `MedicalCertificate` and `ReferralLetter`.
** What it does: takes in information like the duration of medical leave and referral notes by the doctor to generate the medical certificate and referral letter document respectively.
** Justification: this feature makes it easier to generate documents that need to be frequently generated in a clinic, reducing administrative duties for clinic staff and hopefully shortening wait times for patients.
** Highlights: this feature allows for a seamless transfer of information between doctors and clinic staff, as well as a fast retrieval of information from the application's database of `Patient` and `Medicine` information.


* *Minor enhancement*: added *shorthand codes or aliases* for most of the commands in CLInic to reduce the amount of typing necessary when using the CLI.
** Justification: Some commands like `dispenseMedicine` and `MedicalCertificate` are really long, so it can be troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute the command.
