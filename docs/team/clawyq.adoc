== PROJECT: CLInic

---

== Introduction

This Project Portfolio Page documents my contributions to the development of `CLInic`, the product of a team of five
students from NUS School Of Computing as part of the `CS2103T Software Engineering` module. The main
features of the application are coded in `Java` while the GUI is handled by `JavaFX`, `HTML` and `CSS`.

`CLInic` is a desktop application made to manage and expedite operations in clinics. It was inspired by
the Command Line Interface (CLI), which allowed users to type commands to the computer efficently.
However, the CLI's non-visual display and walls of cryptic text makes it intimidating to the general,
non-tech-savvy populous.

These reasons were the main impetus behind `CLInic`, which marries the **simplistic design** and
**efficient command issuing mechanism** of the CLI with an **intuitive** Graphical User Interface (GUI).
This culminated in an application that is easy for **anyone** to use, all while providing the powerful
 functionalities and efficiencies offered by a CLI. Below are some of the key features provided by `CLInic`:

* Allows users to manage patient and medicine information
* Allows users to easily generate documents to be issued by a clinic like `Medical Certificates` efficiently
* Provides intuitive workarounds to normally arduous but common administrative tasks such as restocking
and dispensing medicine

I played a major role in the development of the `Document` class, the relevant `Receipt`, `MedicalCertificate`
and `ReferralLetter` classes that extend it and the relevant patient management operations that are required for
them to work.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implementation of the `Document` class, its accompanying HTML template and
extending classes, which include `Receipt`, `MedicalCertificate` and `ReferralLetter`.
** What it does: It takes in the information of a document that is to be printed by the clinic and
generates a `HTML` file for it.
** Justification: This functionality simplifies the generation of documents that are required by the clinic.
This makes the administrative tasks in the clinic easier and faster, boosting the productivity of its users
translating into shorter wait times at the clinic for the patients.
** Highlights: This functionality allows for seamless transfer of information from doctors to receptionists
of the clinic during consultation, which when coupled with the fast retrieval of information from the
application's database of `Patient` and `Medicine` information, makes for efficient generation of relevant
documents.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Improved and helped with the implementation of `ServedPatient` and `ServedPatientListManager`, which are intermediate
abstractions that helped 'finalise' the information to be used for the generation of `Document`.
** Integrated `MedicalCertificate` with the `DocumentAddContentCommand`.
** Implemented the `HTML` template which all the classes that extend `Document` use to format their own information.
