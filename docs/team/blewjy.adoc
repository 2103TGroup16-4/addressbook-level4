== PROJECT: CLInic

---

== Overview

CLInic is a desktop application made for clinics. The CLI in CLInic stands for Command Line Interface, which is the main method to use this application.
CLInic also has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display information in a structured and user-friendly manner. This application uses Java as the
programming language and uses JavaFX, HTML and CSS for the GUI.

My main responsibility for this project was to implement the UI and storage for the application, amidst some other smaller tasks,
such as the development of the `MedicalRecord` attribute of the `Patient`.

The project scope for CLInic is to morph the given addressbook-level4 into a clinic management application that allows users to manage patient
information and medicine information and additionally manage the clinic queue.

The team consists of four year-2 and one year-3 student in School of Computing, NUS.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *GUI for the Patient Queue Management System (PQMS)*
** What it does: This GUI window, which resides near the top of the application window, displays to the user the current state of the PQMS.
** Justification: Having a responsive GUI allows users to be able to refer to and read the queue easily, and to perform any commands on the queue quickly, without having to always call a `queue` command to retrieve required queue information.
** Highlights: This feature was implemented with the help of a little HTML for the display and Javascript that allowed the updating of the information in the GUI after each command.
 It required a lot of synchronization between the command results, model objects and the display.
 This was largely handled with some event handling and scripting.

* *Major enhancement*: Added *storage capabilities* for the `MedicalRecord` model and the `Medicine` model.
** What it does: This allows the user to be able to add and retrieve `MedicalRecord` and `Medicine` objects to the database easily and efficiently.
** Justification: Before this enhancement, any user action that added `MedicalRecord` and `Medicine` to the database will not be saved once the user closes the application.
 We wanted the user to be able to save these information for future use as well.
** Highlights: This feature was implemented with the use of XML, similar to how `Patient` objects were saved to the file in the original _addressbook-level4_ application.
 It required the creation of an `XmlAdapted-` version of each model object as well as careful handling of the adding and retrieval for each model object.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Added ability for each `Document` to appear in a pop-up window after the respective `Document` commands.
** Added the GUI display for all the `Medicine` objects in the database. This GUI display replaces the left panel displaying the `Patient` objects whenever a `Medicine` related command is called.
** Added `addMedicalRecordCommand` that allows user to add a `MedicalRecord` to a specified `Patient`.

* *Other contributions*:

** Documentation:
*** Improved the navigability and readability of the User Guide by separating Section 3 (Features) into sub-sections.
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Updated the GUI display under `BrowserPanel` to show other information such as `CurrentPatient`, PQMS, and `Patient`.
** Testing:
*** Wrote tests for all UI features to increase coverage from 75% to 79% (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W16-4/main/pull/111[#111])
