== PROJECT: CLInic

---

== Overview

CLInic is a desktop application made for clinics. The CLI in CLInic stands for Command Line Interface, which is main method to use this application.
CLInic also has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display information in a structured and user-friendly manner. This application uses Java as the
programming language and uses JavaFX, HTML and CSS for the GUI.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added a *Patient Queue Management System (PQMS)*
** What it does: This system allows the clinic to keep track of the queue in the clinic.
** Justification: This system improves the product significantly because it has created another use case for this application apart from just storing patient and medicine information.
** Highlights: This system builds upon existing commands, patient information and medicine information. This system attempts to model the real life queue system in the clinic and the commands
are made to be as intuitive as possible.

* *Minor enhancement*: Integration of `ReceiptCommand` and PQMS.
